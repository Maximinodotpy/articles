# Svelte and SvelteKit Tips and Tricks

[Svelte and SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) are awesome frameworks and after working with them for an extendet period of time now I have learned a lot of little tips and tricks that have proven very useful to me. Of course it could be that some of these things are obvious for some people but just don't mind that. I'll also mention some of my preferenses at the end.

## My Svelte and SvelteKit Preferences

Speaking of CSS and styling I really like to use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). It just gives me the most amount of control over the design of my website, while Svelte ensures that I don't have too much duplication in my code.

In case you have the time you could also look at an [article](https://maximmaeder.com/svelte-ui-libraries/) where I compiled a lot of frameworks for Svelte and SvelteKit.
