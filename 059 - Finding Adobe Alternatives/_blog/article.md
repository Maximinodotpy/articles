After four long years, I’ll finally finish my apprenticeship this July. I’ve learned a ton about design and all that good stuff — but the hardest thing I’ll have to face? Losing my precious free access to [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ch_de/creativecloud.html). Tragic, I know.

That’s why I’ve bravely set out on a quest to find free (and hopefully open-source) alternatives to Adobe CC programs like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro. My wallet simply can’t handle the subscription life.

## Raw Photo Editing (Lightroom)

Rawtherapee Sucks

Darktable

I love the way it goes about shortcuts

Masking is rather hard or a little bit

## Photo Editing (Photoshop)

<!-- Gimp -->

## Video Editing (Premiere)

## Vector Graphics (Illustrator)

At times Illustrator was the Adobe Software that I used the most and I have to say I really like it, the only bad things about are maybe the new AI Features that never helped and thats like all other Adobe Programs more on the slow side.

Having said that there is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), that 

There is also [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/de/designer/), but I havent tried that one out since I'm searching fully free alternatives.
