## Getting Assets

Of course, you'll want to enhance your videos with funny, interesting, and fitting clipsâ€”whether they're memes or something more serious. Finding and downloading such clips can be challenging, but there are some tips and tricks that make it easier.

### Finding Assets

<!-- Consider adding sources like Pixabay Sounds, Freesound.org, etc. -->

### Downloading from YouTube

When you come across a YouTube video you'd like to download, you have a couple of options:

- Use [Free Online Converter](https://freeonlineconverter.org/) if you're only interested in downloading audio.
- Alternatively, remove the "ube" from the YouTube URL (e.g., `youtu.com`) to access a website that lets you download the video or audio. Note that this method usually only provides low-quality downloads unless you pay for premium access.

If you want to download large quantities of videos or audio from YouTube, you might want to automate the process using programming tools. Here are some popular options:

- In Python, use [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube).
- In JavaScript, you could use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate interaction with these sites via a headless browser.
