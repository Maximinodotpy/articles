### Downloading from Youtube

When you come across a youtube video that you would like to download you could either make use of [https://freeonlineconverter.org/](https://freeonlineconverter.org/), in case you only want to download audio or you could also remove the "ube" from the url, which will take you to another website to download the video or audio (Only in a rather bad quality if you are not willing to pay).

Maybe you'll want to download large quantities of videos and audios from youtube, in that case you could make use of your programming skills. There are several packages made for this purpose. In python you could make use of [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) or in js you could use [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to create a program that uses the UI of the aferomentioned websites to automatically download videos.
